# UX Patterns & Architecture

This skill guides UX decisions that make interfaces feel intuitive and frictionless. The goal: users complete their tasks without noticing the interface.

**Mantra:** Don't make users think. Let them work.

## Core UX Principles

### 1. Show What's Needed, Hide What's Not
Every element competes for attention. Earn every pixel.
- Primary actions visible, secondary tucked away
- Context determines what's shown
- Progressive disclosure over information overload

### 2. Keep Users Oriented
Users should always know: Where am I? Where can I go? How do I get back?
- Clear navigation hierarchy
- Visible breadcrumbs for deep content
- Consistent location indicators

### 3. Make Actions Reversible
Confident users move fast. Let them undo mistakes.
- Undo over confirmation dialogs
- Soft delete with recovery
- Auto-save with version history

### 4. Reduce Decisions
Every choice is cognitive load. Make smart defaults.
- Sensible defaults based on context
- Remember user preferences
- Offer presets over many options

### 5. Keep Users Informed
Never leave users wondering what's happening.
- Loading states with progress
- Clear success/error feedback
- Visible system status

## Decision Framework

### When Designing a Page

Ask in order:

1. **What's the one job of this page?**
   - If it has multiple jobs, it might need to be multiple pages
   - Every element should support that job

2. **What must users see immediately?**
   - Page title and context
   - Primary action
   - Enough content to understand the page

3. **What can be revealed later?**
   - Secondary actions → overflow menu
   - Advanced options → "Show more" or section
   - Rare features → settings or help

4. **What are all the states?**
   - Empty: What should user do?
   - Loading: What are we waiting for?
   - Error: How do they recover?
   - Success: What's next?

### When Choosing a Pattern

| User Need | Pattern |
|-----------|---------|
| Navigate structure | Sidebar navigation |
| Find specific item | Search + filters |
| Browse options | Cards or list |
| Complete a task | Form or wizard |
| See overview | Dashboard |
| Focus on one thing | Full-page view |
| Quick reference | Slide-over panel |
| Immediate action | Inline editing |

### When Showing Information

| Amount | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| 2-5 options | Segmented control, radio cards |
| 5-15 options | Dropdown, list |
| 15+ options | Search + filter |
| Hierarchical | Tree, nested lists |
| Comparative | Table, cards side-by-side |
| Temporal | Timeline, activity feed |

### When Asking for Confirmation

| Risk Level | Pattern |
|------------|---------|
| Low (reversible) | No confirmation, offer undo |
| Medium (recoverable) | Toast with undo |
| High (hard to reverse) | Confirmation dialog |
| Critical (irreversible) | Explicit acknowledgment (type to confirm) |

## Page Anatomy Checklist

Every page needs:

- [ ] **Clear title** — What is this page?
- [ ] **Context** — How did I get here? (breadcrumb or back)
- [ ] **Primary action** — What can I do? (top-right)
- [ ] **Main content** — Why I'm here
- [ ] **Clear states** — Loading, empty, error handled

### Header Pattern
```
← Back to [Parent]                              [Secondary] [Primary]
Page Title
Optional description or metadata
[Tab 1] [Tab 2] [Tab 3]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

## Quick Heuristics

### The 3-Second Test
Show any screen for 3 seconds. User should know:
- What page is this?
- What's the main action?
- How do I get back?

### The Squint Test
Blur the screen. Can you still see:
- Primary vs secondary content?
- Where to click/tap?
- Visual grouping?

### The "What If" Test
- What if there's 0 items? (empty state)
- What if there's 1 item? (singular language)
- What if there's 1000 items? (pagination/virtualization)
- What if text is very long? (truncation)
- What if user is offline? (graceful degradation)
- What if action fails? (error recovery)

## Reference Files

Detailed patterns organized by domain:

- **[navigation.md](references/navigation.md)** — Wayfinding, navigation hierarchy, information scent, breadcrumbs, modern nav patterns
- **[layouts.md](references/layouts.md)** — Page structure, visual hierarchy, content zones, responsive strategies, density
- **[simplification.md](references/simplification.md)** — Modern alternatives to old patterns, progressive disclosure, smart defaults, reducing complexity
- **[copy.md](references/copy.md)** — UX writing, labels, error messages, empty states, onboarding copy
- **[control.md](references/control.md)** — User agency, undo patterns, keeping users informed, preventing mistakes, building trust

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Navigation:**
- Hidden navigation on desktop (hamburger menus)
- Icons without labels
- More than 3-4 levels deep
- Breaking the back button

**Information:**
- Showing everything at once
- Important info below the fold with no indication
- Inconsistent terminology
- Technical jargon in user-facing copy

**Actions:**
- "Are you sure?" for everything
- No undo for destructive actions
- "Submit" instead of specific action
- Actions that don't match their labels

**Feedback:**
- Silent failures
- Generic error messages ("Error")
- No loading indicators
- Auto-dismissing important messages

## Quick Reference

### Modern Pattern Replacements

| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| Dropdown (few options) | Segmented control |
| Dropdown (many options) | Combobox with search |
| Modal for editing | Slide-over panel or inline edit |
| "Are you sure?" dialogs | Undo after action |
| Pagination | Infinite scroll or load more |
| Multi-page wizard | Single page with sections |
| Tooltip-only help | Inline help text |
| Accordion FAQ | Expanded sections + search |

### Empty State Formula

```
Title:       What this area is for
Description: Why empty + what to do  
Action:      [Primary CTA]
```

### Error Message Formula

```
What happened + Why (if helpful) + How to fix
```

### Button Label Rules

- Use specific verbs: "Save changes" not "Submit"
- Match the trigger: Link says "Edit" → button says "Save"
- Destructive: Repeat the action verb in confirmation
