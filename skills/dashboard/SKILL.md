# Dashboard Design Skill

A collaborative partner for creating modern, actionable dashboards. **Never assume—always ask.**

## How This Skill Works

This skill uses progressive disclosure. The core workflow and principles are here; detailed guidance is in reference files loaded when needed.

**At each phase, consult the relevant reference file:**

| Phase | Reference File | Use When |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Requirements | [requirements.md](requirements.md) | Starting a dashboard, gathering functional/visual preferences |
| Strategy | [strategy.md](strategy.md) | Classifying dashboard type, prioritizing metrics |
| Layout | [information-architecture.md](information-architecture.md) | Choosing layout patterns (hero, bento, magazine, etc.) |
| Charts | [visualization.md](visualization.md) | Selecting chart types, writing insight text |
| Aesthetics | [visual-design.md](visual-design.md) | Defining colors, typography, density |
| Widgets | [components.md](components.md) | Building complete widget specifications |
| States | [edge-states.md](edge-states.md) | Designing empty/loading/error states |
| Quality | [validation.md](validation.md) | Final validation before delivery |

- [design-tokens.md](design-tokens.md) — CSS design token system
- [requirements-questions.md](requirements-questions.md) — Complete question library

## Validation Checkpoints (Always Complete)

These checkpoints should always be triggered. Skipping them leads to issues caught late and rework.

| Checkpoint | When | What |
|------------|------|------|
| Checkpoint 5 | Before implementation | Conceptual validation against checklists |
| Checkpoint 6 | After implementation | Visual testing in browser |

## Five Modern Dashboard Principles

Every dashboard embodies these principles:

### 1. Charts + Insights (Not Just Charts)
```
WRONG: Chart with only a title
RIGHT: Chart with insight: "APAC drove 60% of growth, up 34% YoY"
```
Every visualization includes headline insights, context, and annotations.

### 2. Appropriate Chart Variety
```
WRONG: Default to bar/line for everything
RIGHT: Match chart type to data:
  - Conversion data → Funnel chart
  - Multi-attribute comparison → Radar chart
  - Time × category patterns → Heatmap
  - Flow between categories → Sankey diagram
```

### 3. Creative Layouts (Not Just Card Grids)
```
WRONG: Always "4 KPIs, 2 charts, 1 table"
RIGHT: Consider the story:
  - Hero layout: Large focal visualization
  - Magazine layout: Narrative flow
  - Hub & spoke: Central KPI with breakdowns
  - Bento box: Mixed-size visual variety
```

### 4. Actionable Dashboards (Not Dead Ends)
```
WRONG: Static display only
RIGHT: Every widget answers "What can I do next?"
  - Primary CTA: "View Details →"
  - Drill-down paths: Click region → see breakdown
  - Quick actions: "Export", "Share", "Investigate"
```

### 5. Complete Widget Specifications
```
WRONG: "Put a line chart here"
RIGHT: Chart + Title + Insight + Legend + Context + CTA + States
```

## Decision Classification

Before proceeding with ANY aspect, classify decisions:

### Must Ask (User Preference Required)
- Visual theme (dark/light/brand colors)
- Design aesthetic (minimal, data-dense, modern, corporate)
- Color palette preferences
- Typography preferences
- Layout density preference
- Metric prioritization

### Should Ask (Offer Options)
- Dashboard type classification (confirm recommendation)
- Layout structure options
- Chart type alternatives
- Mobile/responsive strategy

### Can Decide (Best Practice Applies)
- Accessibility compliance (always WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Data-ink ratio principles
- Contrast ratios
- Grid alignment

## Collaboration Workflow

### Checkpoint 1: Initial Analysis

When user makes request, I:
1. Acknowledge the request
2. Identify what's clear vs. unclear
3. List decisions needing user input
4. Ask targeted questions

**Reference**: [requirements.md](requirements.md) for question sequences and conversation patterns.

```
"I'd be happy to help! Based on your request, I understand:
✓ [What's clear]
? I need to clarify:

1. **Visual Direction**: Clean/minimal, data-dense, modern, or corporate?
2. **Theme**: Light mode, dark mode, or both?
3. **Top Priorities**: Which 1-2 metrics are most critical?"
```

### Checkpoint 2: Requirements Confirmation

Before moving to strategy:

**Reference**: [requirements.md](requirements.md) for complete checklist.

```
"Here's what I've gathered:
[Requirements summary]

**Functional**: Purpose, users, metrics, comparisons
**Visual**: Theme, aesthetic, brand, density

Does this accurately capture your needs?"
```

### Checkpoint 3: Strategy Proposal

Before moving to design:

**Reference**: [strategy.md](strategy.md) for type classification and prioritization.

```
"Based on your requirements, here's my recommended approach:

**Dashboard Type**: [Type] — because [reasoning]
**Metric Priority**:
1. [Critical] — Top-left, largest display
2. [Important] — Top-right
3. [Supporting] — Lower sections

Does this align with your vision?"
```

### Checkpoint 4: Design Options

Present visual options before finalizing:

**References**:
- [information-architecture.md](information-architecture.md) — Layout patterns
- [visualization.md](visualization.md) — Chart selection
- [visual-design.md](visual-design.md) — Aesthetics
- [components.md](components.md) — Widget specifications

```
"For the visual design, I have options:

**Layout Pattern Options:**
A) Hero Layout — Large focal visualization
B) Bento Box — Mixed-size cards
C) Magazine — Narrative flow
D) Hub & Spoke — Central KPI with breakdowns

**Chart Style Options:**
A) Insightful (charts with headlines and context)
B) Minimal (clean, essential data only)
C) Detailed (annotations, reference lines)

Which combination appeals to you?"
```

### Checkpoint 5: Conceptual Design Validation

Before implementation, validate the design against checklists:

**References**:
- [validation.md](validation.md) — Conceptual validation checklist
- [visualization.md](visualization.md) — Data-appropriate visualization check
- [components.md](components.md) — Widget checklist and density guidelines

```
"Before I implement, let me validate the design:

**Widget Checklist (Theoretical Pass):**
✓ Each widget has: title, insight, visual, context, CTA, states
✓ Data-appropriate visualization check completed
✓ Layout density reviewed against anti-patterns
✓ All required elements accounted for

**Design Validation:**
- Chart types match data characteristics
- Widgets won't be cramped at target sizes
- Visual hierarchy is clear

Does this design direction look correct before I proceed with implementation?"
```

This is a conceptual/checklist review — you're validating the PLAN, not the rendered output.

### Checkpoint 6: Visual Testing & Delivery

After implementation is complete, view the dashboard in browser:

**Reference**: [validation.md](validation.md) for visual testing checklist.

```
"Now that implementation is complete, I'll review the rendered output:

**Visual Testing:**
✓ Viewed at intended viewport size
✓ Overall visual balance and breathing room verified
✓ Each widget checked against density guidelines
✓ Visualizations differentiate actual data values
✓ User flow walked through end-to-end
✓ Edge states tested with real-world scenarios

**What I implemented:**
- [Key decision 1]: [What was chosen]
- [Key decision 2]: [What was chosen]

**Final Verification:**
✓ Requirements met
✓ Visual preferences honored
✓ Accessibility compliant
✓ Edge states working

What would you like to adjust?"
```

Review the complete dashboard first, then check each widget within it.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Layout Anti-Patterns
- Always defaulting to "4 KPIs + 2 charts + table"
- Every widget same size in a grid
- Metrics crammed into top row without breathing room

### Chart Anti-Patterns
- Using bar charts for everything
- Chart with only a title, no insight text
- Plain chart without comparison context

### Actionability Anti-Patterns
- Dashboard as dead-end display
- "View Details" as only generic action
- No drill-down paths

### Widget Anti-Patterns
- Missing legends on multi-series charts
- No loading/empty/error states
- Incomplete specifications

### Process Anti-Patterns
- Applying visual defaults without mentioning them
- Skipping straight to execution on subjective choices
- Assuming user wants "best practices" over their preferences
- Proceeding without confirming understanding
